For new installations, the program should check whether the db has any tables and, if it doesnt, create them like described here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5866154/how-to-create-table-if-it-doesnt-exist-using-derby-db

Rename the package.

(No metadata retrieved from enitity sentiment analysis (guess thats only available in entity analysis though).

Dont store direct messages to the bot in the db.

[DONE] Log sentiment analysis in seperate table.

[DONE] Add user names to db (in a separate table?).

(Reporting from the command line.)

(Twitter :^)

Add categories as a table field (like [Work_Of_Art])

The final report should be something like this: "Harry likes a, b and d. He dislikes e, f and g". He talks a lot about h. His favourite artist is i and his favourite work of art is j. He seems to generally be in a better mood than last week."

Pronouns.
