For new installations, the program should check whether the db has any tables and, if it doesnt, create them like described here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5866154/how-to-create-table-if-it-doesnt-exist-using-derby-db

No metadata retrieved from enitity sentiment analysis (guess thats only available in entity analysis though).

Dont store direct messages to the bot in the db.

Log sentiment analysis in seperate table.

Two new functions to analyse db data.
